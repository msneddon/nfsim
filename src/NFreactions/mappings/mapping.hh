	 	required.  It is maintained by a MappingSet which is just a collection of
	 	Mapping objects.  The "type" of mapping is identified in the same way as the
	 	"type" of transformation.  See the Transformation class for a list of those
	 	types.  The "index" simply is the index of the binding site or state of a molecule.
	 	It is possible that some "types" do not require an "index" (as in the case of
	 	adding or deleting an entire molecule).
