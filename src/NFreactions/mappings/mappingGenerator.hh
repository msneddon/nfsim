	/*!
	   MapGenerators are simple objects given to TemplateMolecules (so are maintained and
	   deleted by TemplateMolecule objects) that assign Mapping objects to particular
	   Molecule objects.  This allows us to Map specific components of a reactant as
	   we compare the potential molecules to the TemplateMolecule.  (see the TemplateMolecule
	   compare() functions).  If there is a match, the Template Molecule uses this to assign
	   a mapping.  This class is useful because it knows which Mapping to use in the
	   MappingSet provided in the map() function.  This is necessary information as we always
	   reuse Mapping and MappingSet objects for effeciency.
