	//!  Maintains a list of MappingSets needed by ReactionClass
	/*!
	  This is essentially a specialized vector implementation that allows a ReactionClass
	  to easily keep track of all the MappingSet objects that can be involved in the reaction.
	  All MappingSet objects stored in this class are created once and reused throughout the
	  course of the simulation.  This prevents new MappingSet objects to be created and destroyed.
	  This class has the ability to automatically expand its capacity when extra mappings are
	  needed, so there is no need for the user to manage these details.  This class allows for
	  constant time removal, insertion, and random selection of MappingSets, while std::vector
	  requires linear time removal.  We gain this speedup because the ordering of the list
	  is unimportant.  To use this class, call the pushNextAvailableMappingSet to get a pointer
	  to the available MappingSet.  Pass this MappingSet to a TemplateMolecule to actually
	  map it onto molecules.  If you don't end up using this MappingSet, call popLastMappingSet
	  immediately.  To remove MappingSets, call removeMappingSet with the ID of the MappingSet
	  you want to remove.  You can get this Id from the MappingSet object and Molecule objects
	  also keep a vector of the MappingSet objects that point to it.
