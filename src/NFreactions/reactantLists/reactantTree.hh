	/*!
	 *  This is one of the more complex classes in NFsim.  It is written in order to handle
	 *  distribution of rates reactions.  These types of reactions have many reactants, but
	 *  each reactant can participate with a different rate.  The rate is determined by the
	 *  set of molecules that the reactant is connected to.  Therefore, we need a tree (or we could have also
	 *  used logarithmic classes) to efficiently select the next reactant weighted by
	 *  each of its propensities.
	 *
	 *  A key example of this is in the chemotaxis system.  Clusters of receptors influence
	 *  the rate of CheA autophosphorylation.
